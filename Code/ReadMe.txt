All the code implement in face_util_func.py are functions that need to be used in the reconstruct and Recognition process.
All the code implement in Test.py are test perform to reconstruct faces mentioned in the
project.
To perform each test in the Test.py, I strongly suggest that when you perform each test, 
just commented out other code which is not relevent.And the path of the face should also changed to according path( Like I comment in the code).
